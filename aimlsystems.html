                in one way or another. This page is a breakdown of my most memorable experiences.</h3>

            <h1>Machine Intelligence Systems</h1>
            <h2>As a student, I had coursework that delved into the fascinating world of machine intelligence systems. One standout project involved analyzing a dataset of Titanic passengers,
                including information such as <span>their names, age, social class, whether they survived or not,</span> and so on. I learned how to write code to 
                <span>make predictions on missing data using previous experience.</span> Here is some of what I accomplished.
            </h2>
            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Data Preprocessing:</span> I meticulously cleaned up the data, dropping unnecessary values like ticket numbers and cabin information.</p>
            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Feature Engineering:</span> I even considered the impact of family names on survival rates. I predicted that wealthier family names would correlate with a better chance of survival.</p>
            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Predictive Modeling:</span> By feeding the data through various machine learning algorithms, I made predictions about the passengers’ 
                chance of survival. One final take I thought was interesting, my final analysis revealed a 2-to-1 ratio of female to male survivors.</p>

            <h2>
                I designed a web-based AI Simulation inspired by <span>cellular automata</span>. Here are the Highlights:

            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Cell Classes</span> </p>
            <p class="content-listitem2"><span>- Agressors:</span> These factions preferred attacking other cells.</p>
            <p class="content-listitem2"><span>- Defenders:</span> These cells were more passive, avoided conflict and focused on reinforcing their population</p>
            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Competition</span> The goal was simple — become the final team standing. The varying behaviors of cells made this simulation engaging and complex</p>

            <h1>Golden Gloves Boxing AI</h1>
            <h2>As a VR Game Developer, I tackled the challenge of creating an interactive AI opponent for a poxing game. This AI went through several stages during the development process:
            </h2>
            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Standard Game AI:</span> Initially, I used custom, but static logic for the AI. It worked, but we aimed for a more sophisticated approach</p>
            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Behavior Tree-Based AI:</span> Next, we implemented a behavior tree that considered inputs like position relative to the player, a status 
                condition comparable to opponent health, and player actions. This allowed the AI to react more intelligently.</p>
            <p class="content-listitem"><span>- Advanced Behavior System:</span> Our final design surpassed the behavior tree. It made predictions about the player based on their moves, 
                incorporating variable reaction time and decision making.</p>
