            <h3>Engine Room VR</h3>
            <p>
                Was one of the two initial developers for the development 
            of <span>Golden Gloves VR</span>, a boxing application 
            released for Meta Quest in December 2022, 
            worked with coaches and trainers to create a 
            fun to play health app that anyone could train, 
            and compete with. 
            Developed game character AI, met with users for testing and 
            product analysis on what could be done, and made clear 
            priorities of work to focus on.

                In the process, I also handled bug tracking and fixes, and ensured the virtual equipment had real physical feel and feedback. My contributions significantly improved user experience and the overall functionality of the app.

            </p>
            <p>The project had multiple rounds of demonstration and testing. the most basic testing would include the trainers at the on site boxing gym, who could provide feedback based on personal experiences. we also had two live demos of the game, one of which was held at the Golden Gloves Nationals tournament in August 2022. 

                Our other demo took place at The Engine Room Gym, where we received feedback from both amateur boxers and regulars who frequently trained there. Throughout these demos, I was responsible for implementing changes based on the feedback received to continuously improve the app's performance.</p>
