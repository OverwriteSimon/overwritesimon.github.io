            <p>Hi! Thanks for checking out my Portfolio. I am a Graduate of Full Sail University 
                with a Bachelor's of Science in Software Development. 
                I have worked on many various projects, such as working as a 
                full stack web developer, working as an indie C++ programmer,
                 and a professional virtual reality programmer.</p>

            <h3>Software Developer</h3>
            <p>
                I have been an inspired programmer since 2012, 
                when I went to my first tech convention, 
                Students Involved with Technology (SIT). I was given
                an opportunity to see behind the scenes construction of
                media like games and got an opportunity to see developers in the 
                industry
                as well as students inspired by their developments.
                I like to spend my free time gaming, 
                exploring the outdoors when I can, and cooking.

                <h3>Virtual Reality Development</h3>
                <p>As one of the initial developers for Golden Gloves VR, a boxing application, I worked on game character AI, user testing, and physics tuning. Handled bug tracking and fixes, and ensured the virtual equipment had a realistic feel. My contributions improved user experience and app functionality. The project underwent multiple rounds of testing and demonstrations, with feedback from trainers, amateur boxers, and regular gym-goers used to continuously improve the app's performance.</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>My experience as a web developer includes creating web pages based on client needs, ranging from simple HTML and JavaScript websites to more complex ones using ReactJS and NodeJS. I also ventured into Augmented Reality web page design, creating interactive and immersive content.</p>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    I have created prototypes as a student, as well as in my professional career. Beginning with an Arduino based device I was allowed to tinker with, I created a gps based device for 
                    geocaching, the device integrated with the Google Maps API to showcase locations visited by the user
